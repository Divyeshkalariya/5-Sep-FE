<p> Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.<br>
It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing.</p>
<u style="background-color: brown; font-color:green; font-size: 20px; border: 3px dashed black;">It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.</u>
